This repository is about my mern-16 projects. 
Task 1 is just a basic assignment realted to box-model, specificity and style.
Task 2 is a resume building project.
It is designed using flex, grid and positioning.
By clicking on the task shown in task2.html file, you will be shown a code which was pushed before making changes.
The new code will be shown on clicking the task2.html file and not the Task one.
